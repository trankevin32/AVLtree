# AVLtree
AVL tree data structure to hold student information. 

This program takes a user input for the number of students there are, then allows the user to input the students first and last name, email, and ID number. This all gets stored in the AVL tree. The purpose of this project is to compare the number of searches between a linear search and AVL tree search.
